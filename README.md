# Jonathan Lee - Mathematics and Economics Student Portfolio
  ## **About**
  
  Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan. I'm currently a Mathematics & Economics student at Western Washington University. 
  During my studies, I have acquired technical skills with Rstudio and a deep understanding of Excel. 
  My knowledge of probability and statistical inferences includes but is not limited to:

 - probability
 - conditional probability
 - binomial distribution
 - Central Limit Theorem
 - confidence intervals
 - hypothesis testing
 - multiple linear regression
 
   
  I am currently expanding my mathematical and computer science comprehension in Linear Algebra and Python.
  This is a repository to showcase analytical skills and share recent projects.

  ### **Math 342 Assignments**
   #### **Real Estate Appraisal Analysis**
   **Code:** [`Appraisal_Code.R`](https://github.com/JONATHAN-LEE-01/About/blob/main/Appraisal%20Code.R)
   **Presentation:** [`Appraisal_Analysis.pdf`](https://github.com/JONATHAN-LEE-01/About/blob/main/Appraisal_Analysis.pdf)
   
   **Description:** 
The second workshop in Math 342 (Probability and Statistical Inferences). This data, which was pulled from the paper *"Using Multiple Regression Analysis in Real Estate Appraisal"* (*Appraisal Journal* [2002]:424-430), contains sale price, size, and land-to-building ratio for 10 large industrial properties. This assignment is guided with the following steps: separate the data into two categories (price and size), make a scatterplot and obtain correlation coefficient, calculate least-sums estimates, run an ANOVA table to perform F-test, construct a 95% confidence interval, make a scatterplot of the residuals to check for constant variance and linearity, plot the normal Q-Q and run the Wilk-Shapiro testto check if the normality assumption is satisfied, graph the standardized residuals with boundaries to identify possible outliers, and plot the leverage values with boundaries to identify influential observations.
