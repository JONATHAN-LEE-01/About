# **About**
  
  Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan. I am currently a Mathematics & Economics student at Western Washington University. 
  During my studies, I have acquired technical skills on Rstudio and a deep understanding of Excel. 
  My knowledge of Rstudio includes but is not limited to, probability, conditional probability, binomial distribution, 
  Central Limit Theorem, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, multiple linear regression, etc. 
  Currently I am expanding my mathematical and computer science comprehension in Linear Algebra and Python. 
  This is a repository to showcase analytical skills and share recent projects.
