  Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan. I'm currently a Mathematics & Economics student at Western Washington University. 
  During my studies, I have acquired technical skills with Rstudio and a deep understanding of Excel. 
  My knowledge of probability and statistical inferences includes but is not limited to:
  <ul>
  <li>probability</li>
  <li>conditional probability</li>
  <li>binomial distribution</li>
  <li>Central Limit Theorem</li>
  <li>confidence intervals</li>
  <li>hypothesis testing</li>
  <li>multiple linear regression</li>
  </ul>
   
  I am currently expanding my mathematical and computer science comprehension in Linear Algebra and Python.
  This is a repository to showcase analytical skills and share recent projects.
